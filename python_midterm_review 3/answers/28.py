# 28. Create at least 10 tests. 
# Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

# A test should look like this:
# print(29+3 == 32, “This will be True”)
              
# Or like this
# city = “Chongqing, China”
# print(“Chongqing, china” == city, “This will be False”)

# These 5 will evaluate to True
